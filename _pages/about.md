Hello everyone, welcome to my website! My name is Chun-Kai Yao; my friends usually just call me Sean. I got my bachelor degrees in EE and CS at UIUC on May, 2021, and just graduated from UIUC as a Master student in Electrical and Comptuer Engineering on August,2023. 

My research focus was signal processing algorithm development for FMCW/SFCW radars. I moved to NJ/NY area after I graduated and currently looking for a job. Since I love my research, I'm still helping my lab with algorithm developing and data processing for some of the works and papers. 

For my hobbies, I love cooking, baking, brewing coffee, video gaming, and a lot more. Although life is too short to explore all the possibilities, I'll still explore more interesting things to do!
